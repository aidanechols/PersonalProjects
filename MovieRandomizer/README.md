# MovieRandomizer
Java Gui application that randomizes and sorts movies. 

Current application is still in alpha testing. Long term goal is to add a list of IMDB or Netflix films.

Goal is to help movie watchers select a movie without having to spend an hour searching through a streaming service for the right film.
